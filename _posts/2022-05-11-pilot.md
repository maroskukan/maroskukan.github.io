Welcome to Buldogchef's blog. In this first pilot post I would like to describe the motivation behind creating a personal blog as well as requirements and challenges that I had to overcome along the way.

# Motivation

Lets start with the motivation, which was mainly to give something back to you, fellow engineers and readers who already publish great stuff. Let's be honest, it often saves the rest us countless hours by not reinventing the wheel again and rather focus on our particular challenge or use case which we are dealing with at any given time. As an author and engineer I also often write code and documentation and it would be pity if it would end in private stash of "todos".

When it comes to my requirements for blog platform these got refined over they years. I have tried fair amount of them, ranging from SaaS (Blogpost, Wordpress), PaaS (Azure App Service) and even IaaS (Azure VM, AWS EC2 with RDS and ELB). Although my blog attempts or previous posts did not survived to this day, the real value came from the practical experience building on each platform.

# Requirements

My primary requirement for this blog itiration is simplicity. Running a web application in proper and secure way can be quite involved. Depending on your stack selection, you may need to manage the application along with its dependencies which including libraries, operating system and infrastucture services.

I want to maximaze the value by focusing on content publishing instead of managing infrastructure that is required to run it. Ideally I would like to set it up once and never need to think about it from operational perspective.

The secondary requirements are captured in table below for reference:

| ID   | Description                                                 |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| SR01 | Publish content written in markdown                         |
| SR02 | Leverage customizable framework or theme                    |
| SR03 | Provide site extensibility for future needs                 |
| SR04 | Notify visitors when new content is added                   |
| SR05 | Provide a discussion place for visitors                     |
| SR06 | Provide a communication method via web form or social media |
| SR07 | Have low costs associate with site operation                |
| SR08 | Have Ad-free content                                        |
| SR09 | Have low technical overhead associated with site operation  |
| SR10 | Provide site authenticity and transport layer security      |
| SR11 | Provide custom top level domain for branding                |
| SR12 | Produce site analytics data for future content enhancements |

The secondary requiremnets that are optional and will not be implemented in the first itiration include:

| ID   | Description                                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SR13 | Leverage tags or categories to group similar content together |
| SR14 | Leverage SEO to increase site traffic                         |
| SR15 | Provide a method to optionally sponsor my work                |

That is a quite long list of secondary requirements that I would like to fulfill, while still alingning with the primary one which was simplicity. In next few sections I am going to provide some overview how I approach them in case you have similar needs.
